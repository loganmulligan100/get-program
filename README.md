# get-programs
The main thing I want to be able to do is to be able to reinstall window and then with 1 file reinstall all the aplications you previouly had installed. as of right now this just finds the files that you have installed. you might need to edit the code incase you get a bunch of random things that you dont need, although it should already do a good job getting exactly what you need without you having to change anything
